## 💡 The "Technologiyaa" Explained

> **Quick Note:** Your brilliant thoughts are saved right here in your browser using `localStorage`. They'll ghost you forever if you clear your site data! 👻

The Digital Napkin is designed for speed and privacy. It achieves this by storing all your notes directly in your browser's `localStorage`.

**What this means for you:**

- **✅ Pros:**
  - **Blazing Fast:** No network requests needed to save or load notes.
  - **Offline First:** Works perfectly without an internet connection.
  - **Private:** Your notes never leave your computer.
  - **No Account Needed:** Just open the page and start typing.

- **⚠️ Cons:**
  - **Browser-Specific:** Your notes are tied to the browser you use on a specific device.

**Solution:** Use the **Export All** feature regularly to back up your notes to an `.xml` file! You can use the **Import** feature to restore them anytime.
